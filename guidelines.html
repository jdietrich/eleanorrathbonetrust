		<h3>Guidelines for Applicants</h3>
		<p>The Trustees concentrate their support largely on the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Charities and charitable projects focused on Merseyside.</li>
		<li>Charities benefiting women and unpopular and neglected causes but avoiding those with a sectarian interest.</li>
		</ul>
		</br>
		<h4>Priorities</h4>
		<p>Charities benefiting women, girls, young people and families, who are economically deprived and/or socially excluded; Unpopular and neglected causes.
		<ul>
		<li><b>1. Merseyside</b></br>Charities and charitable projects that meet our priorities and are based in, and/or delivered in Merseyside, particularly the more deprived areas of the county.</li>
		<li><b>2. Holiday Fund</b></br>We hold a small holiday fund providing small grants for holidays and outings. This is restricted to charities helping disadvantaged children and adults from Merseyside.</li>
		<li><b>3. National</b></br>Charities and charitable projects that meet our priorities, but only those that have a nationwide scope or remit - or whose work is not specific to any geographical area. We do not offer grants to local charities outside of Merseyside.</li>
		<li><b>4. International</b></br>We consider projects delivered in Sub-Saharan Africa, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and projects in Palestine, or supporting Palestinian refugees. Projects must be sponsored and monitored by a UK registered charity. In addition, projects must meet one or more of the following criteria:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>They will benefit women or orphaned children.</li>
				<li>They will demonstrate local involvement in scoping and delivery, except where skills required are not currently available e.g. eye surgeons in remote rural areas.</li> 
				<li>They will aim to repair the damage in countries recently ravaged by international or civil war.</li>
				<li>They will deliver clean water and sanitation.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		</p>
		</br>
		<p>Most grants are for one year, although requests for 2 and 3 year grants will be considered.</p>
		<p>Applications will be considered only from small or medium sized charities.</p>
		<p>We ask organisations who have previously received a grant to wait two years before reapplying. All requests for a further grant must be accompanied by a report on how the previous grant was used.</p>
		<p>Grants are made in the range £1000 to £3,000 for national and international grants, and up to £5,000 for merseyside grants. In exceptional cases grants may be higher.<p>
		<p>Grant total in 2020/2021 was £356,618.</p>
