		<p>Eleanor Rathbone (1872-1946) was the daughter of 
		William Rathbone VI, an outstanding philanthropist dedicated to social 
		reform. Among other achievements he established a District Nursing system 
		in Liverpool which was adopted nationwide.</p>
		<p>Eleanor was the first woman to be elected to 
		Liverpool City Council and represented Granby ward from 1909 to 1934. In 1929 
		she was elected as an independent MP and continued in this position until her 
		death in 1946. She was associated with many campaigns for social reform, 
		particularly on issues affecting women. She is most often associated with the 
		campaign to introduce Family Allowances, finally won in 1945, which has 
		developed into Child Benefit. She was also involved with women's suffrage, 
		human rights, and refugee issues.</p>
		<p>The Eleanor Rathbone Charitable Trust was settled by 
		Trust Deed (charity no. 233241) on February 4th 1947 by the late Dr. BL Rathbone 
		with money left by his aunt Eleanor.</p>
